Based on the repository analysis below, generate a Mermaid flowchart diagram showing the system architecture.

Repository Analysis:
{analysis}

Requirements for the diagram:
1. Use Mermaid flowchart syntax (flowchart TD for top-down or flowchart LR for left-right)
2. Show major components/modules as nodes
3. Show data flow direction with arrows
4. Include external dependencies (databases, APIs, etc.) as distinct node shapes
5. Keep it readable - aim for 5-15 nodes maximum
6. Use clear, concise labels

Output ONLY the Mermaid diagram code, starting with "```mermaid" and ending with "```". Do not include any other text.

Example format:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[CLI Entry] --> B[Core Logic]
    B --> C[Data Layer]
    C --> D[(Database)]
    B --> E[External API]
```
