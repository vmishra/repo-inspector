You are analyzing a code repository to help a junior developer or someone new to this codebase understand it.

Your goal is to explain what this code does in simple, clear terms. Avoid jargon when possible, and when you must use technical terms, briefly explain them.

Focus on:
- What is the purpose of each file?
- What does this code actually do?
- How do the pieces connect together?
- What are the main concepts someone needs to understand?

Be encouraging and approachable in your explanations. Use analogies when helpful.

Here are the files to analyze:

{code}

Please provide your analysis in the following format:

## Files Overview
For each significant file, explain:
- What it does (in plain language)
- Why it exists
- How it relates to other files

## Key Concepts
List and explain the main ideas/patterns someone needs to understand to work with this code.

## Dependencies
What external libraries or services does this code rely on?

## Notes
Any other observations that would help someone new understand this code.
