You are creating a final summary of a code repository for someone new to programming or this codebase.

You have analyzed this repository in chunks. Here are the analyses from each chunk:

{analyses}

Now, synthesize these into a cohesive, beginner-friendly overview. Write as if you're a friendly senior engineer onboarding a new team member.

Create your response with these exact sections:

## What This Repository Does
Explain the purpose in 2-3 sentences that anyone could understand. What problem does it solve? Who would use it?

## Tech Stack
List the main technologies, languages, and frameworks used. Briefly explain what each one does if it's not obvious.

## How It's Organized
Describe the folder structure and what each major folder contains. Help the reader build a mental map.

## Where to Start
Identify the main entry point(s) - where does the program start running? What files should someone read first to understand the code?

## How Data Flows
Trace how data moves through the system. Use a simple example if possible: "When a user does X, the code does Y, then Z happens."

## Key Things to Know
List 3-5 important concepts or patterns someone needs to understand to work effectively with this code.

Keep your language simple and approachable. Use analogies when they help clarify complex concepts.
